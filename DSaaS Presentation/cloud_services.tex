        Definition: a network of services providing on-demand, simple access to elastic, scalable, inexpensive computing platforms~\cite{wang2008scientific}.

    \begin{itemize}
    	\item HaaS
        \item SaaS
    	\item DaaS
        \item PaaS
    \end{itemize}


    DSaaS combines the DaaS and SaaS model.


% Other services combining the \acrshort{daas} and \acrshort{saas} models are collaborative document editing services, such as the office suite component of Google Drive~\cite{googledrive}, where users can share, view, and collaborate on documents from multiple devices.
% This is almost exactly the type of service DSaaS aims to provide, except that the objects stored are data structures rather than specific document types.  
% Besides that, most collaborative document editing services primarily offer partial persistence of documents, while DSaaS provides confluent persistence of data structures.

% The Dat project~\cite{dat} provides version control for data sets, but with an architectural approach different from our own, which is based on a client--server model.
% The similarities are the fine-grained access control and a dedicated \acrshort{api} for managing the data.
